 * There, the seller supplies goods to a buyer and Yukizi renders the document
 * on their behalf. Here Yukizi is the supplier, the seller is the customer,
 * and the supply is a service — the commission, on which GST has already been
 * charged and deducted at source by the payout calculator.

 * Nothing is stored: every figure is derived from the settlement row that was

 * `prisma generate` but never `prisma migrate deploy`, so a new table would
 * exist in the client and not in the database.
