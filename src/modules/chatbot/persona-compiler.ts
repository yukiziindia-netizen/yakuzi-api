/**
 * Turns the Studio's settings into the instructions the model actually reads.
 *
 * This is the piece that lets someone with no technical background train the
 * assistant. They move a dial from "brief" to "thorough"; this writes the
 * sentence a language model needs to hear. Nobody has to write a prompt, and
 * nobody has to guess what a prompt would do.
 *
 * Three rules govern everything here:
 *
 *  1. Say it in words, not numbers. "Answer in one or two sentences" works;
 *     "detail: 20/100" does not — the model has no scale to read it against.
 *  2. Only say what was chosen. A dial left in the middle produces no sentence
 *     at all, because a system prompt padded with neutral statements dilutes
 *     the instructions that do matter.
 *  3. Hard limits come last and are phrased as absolutes. Instructions late in
 *     a prompt carry more weight, and "never" outranks "prefer".
 *
 * Pure and synchronous on purpose: the exact text an admin's settings produce
 * is shown back to them in the Studio, and is covered by tests.
